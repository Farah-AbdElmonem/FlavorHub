                <br>
                3 tablespoons unsalted butter <br>
                2 garlic cloves, minced <br>
                1 shallot, finely chopped <br>
                4 ounces crimini mushrooms, chopped <br>
                4 ounces white button mushrooms, chopped <br>
                2 tablespoons all-purpose flour <br>
                3 cups chicken stock <br>
                ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt, or to taste <br>
                ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste <br>
                Sliced sautéed mushrooms for garnish, optional <br>
                Chopped parsley for garnish, optional <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                - Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large pot such as a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the
                garlic and shallot, cook for 1 minute, until they begin to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for about
                3 minutes, until tender and browned. Transfer all the contents of the pot to a bowl. <br>
                - Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter to the pot. Once melted, sprinkle in the flour and whisk it
                quickly into a paste. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the stock a little at a time, whisking out the
                clumps between each addition.<br>
                - Increase the heat back to medium-high and allow the soup to simmer well for 3 minutes. Add the
                mushrooms back to the pot and continue to cook for 2 more minutes. The stock will thicken slightly to be
                somewhat creamy.<br>
                - Let cook for 3 to 4 minutes, then ladle into bowls. Garnish with mushrooms and parsley, if desired.
